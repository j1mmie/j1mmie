First .plan entry on Github. I've maintained a .plan file for a few months now but much of the information is private. I've decided to start a public .plan file to keep track of my progress, help stay motivated, and share the progress of my projects (currently, mainly, Slipstream) with the community.

Today I am continuing work to reorganize our database's datascheme so that it is easier to perform bulk operations on. To do that, I needed to rip out our previous Object Document Mapping (ODM) layer (Typesaurus). Typesaurus hasn't provided much benefit and has in fact hidden some functionality of Firestore.

Firestore's default library is not much better however, so I had to write my own ORM, or ODM, or whatever, to make it easier to work with. Right now its called DocumentProxy, following the naming conventions of Firestore (DocumentReference, DocumentSnapshot, etc). It is not currently following the ActiveRecord design pattern, but I think it should eventually.

The feature that spurred this reorg / refactor is the ability to award players with XP periodically, outside of battle. The challenges that I faced were:

1. The Firestore API makes it difficult to perform batch updates to subcollections.

You could only do batch updates to subcollections on one parent collection

2. The Firestore client SDK does not provide a way to store data changes in memory.

You can make data changes to the DB, but then you can't modify the data mapping. So if you want to reserialize a record after you've changed it, you need to fetch it again from the DB. This is by design, and there are reasons for it, but Typesaurus did this and worked fine. So I'm creating a lighter-weight ODM layer similar to Typesaurus, but does not hide the underlying Firestore SDK data.
