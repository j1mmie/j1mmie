First .plan entry on Github. I've maintained a .plan file for a few months now but much of the information is private. I've decided to start a public .plan file to keep track of my progress, help stay motivated, and share the progress of my projects (currently, mainly, Slipstream) with the community.

Today I am continuing work to reorganize our database's datascheme so that it
is easier to perform bulk operations on. To do that, I needed to rip out our
previous Object Document Mapping (ODM) layer (Typesaurus). Typesaurus hasn't
provided much benefit and has in fact hidden some functionality of Firestore.

Firestore's default library is not much better however, so I had to write my
own ORM, or ODM, or whatever, to make it easier to work with. Right now its
called DocumentProxy, following the naming conventions of Firestore
(DocumentReference, DocumentSnapshot, etc). It is not currently following the
ActiveRecord design pattern, but I think it should eventually.

The feature that spurred this reorg / refactor is the ability to award players
with XP periodically, outside of battle.
